# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game built using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game features a snake that grows in length as it eats food, and the player's goal is to navigate the snake without hitting the walls or itself.

## How to Play

1. **Control the Snake**:
   - Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake:
     - Up Arrow: Move up
     - Down Arrow: Move down
     - Left Arrow: Move left
     - Right Arrow: Move right

2. **Objective**:
   - Guide the snake to eat the food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer, and the score increases.

3. **Game Over Conditions**:
   - The game ends if the snake collides with the walls of the screen.
   - The game also ends if the snake collides with its own body.
